1. Download the leJOS_NXJ_0.9.1beta-3 software

2. Go to the leJOS_NXJ_0.9.1beta-3/build folder and type in terminal "ant"

3. Add the libbluetooth.so file to the leJOS_NXJ_0.9.1beta-3 dir

4. In terminal, write  "gedit ~/.bashrc" and add the line:

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/afs/inf.ed.ac.uk/user/sXX/sXXXXXX/{PATH_TO_leJOS_FOLDER}/leJOS_NXJ_0.9.1beta-3

Save and close the .bashrc file.

5. In terminal, write  "exec bash"

6. (Possibly not needed, usnure) Pair your computer with the brick through Bluetooth (do PINs properly)

7. Go in leJOS_NXJ_0.9.1beta-3/bin and open in terminal

8. Type ./nxjbrowse - at this point it should find your brick (or at least it shouldn't fail immediately)

9. In /bin and type ./nxjcontrol
