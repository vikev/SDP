// Directions for connecting an NXT brick to a Dice machine via Bluetooth

1. Download the leJOS_NXJ_0.9.1beta-3 source contents for linux from:

	http://sourceforge.net/projects/lejos/files/lejos-NXJ/

2. Go to the leJOS_NXJ_0.9.1beta-3/build folder and type in terminal "ant"

3. Add the libbluetooth.so file from the git repository to the leJOS_NXJ_0.9.1beta-3/bin/ directory

4. In terminal, write  "gedit ~/.profile" and add the line:

	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/afs/inf.ed.ac.uk/user/sXX/sXXXXXX/{PATH_TO_leJOS_FOLDER}/leJOS_NXJ_0.9.1beta-3/bin/

Save and close the .bashrc file.

5. In terminal, write  "exec bash"

6. (Possibly not needed, usnure) Pair your computer with the brick through Bluetooth (do PINs properly)

7. Go in leJOS_NXJ_0.9.1beta-3/bin/ and open in terminal

8. Type ./nxjbrowse - at this point it should find your brick (or at least it shouldn't fail immediately)

9. In /bin and type ./nxjcontrol
