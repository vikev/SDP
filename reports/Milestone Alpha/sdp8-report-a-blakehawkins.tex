\section{Contribution Summary}

It's been three weeks since our last performance review so identifying my most substantial contributions has been difficult. I would say the most useful things I've done this week include:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Performed administrative tasks on trac, documented code using javadoc and noted many "TODO" regions in code; made useful refactorings
	\item Built an abstract Robot class with all the features of our milestone code
	\item Built a basic strategy system after mapping all the necessary states and actions for both robots in different scenarios.
	\item Built a system for recognising collision walls using the vertices accessible from Yordan's vision refactoring
	\item Did some testing regarding distortion in vision feed, and made some unit tests to check some vector maths methods
	\item Made enormous updates to the ball prediction system including recursive reflection recognition, coefficient of restitution, friction abstraction, goal line recognition, plus smoothing using Yordan's gaussian filtering system
	\item Fixed some code regression since the vision refactoring
	\item Implemented boundary recognition and made many tests on its behaviour
\end{itemize}

\section{Self Assessment, Exceptional Contributions}

I would award myself an 8/10 due to the substantial amount of time I put into SDP, most of which was useful in the assessed friendly.\\
\\
I would award an 9/10 to Lubomir Vikev for going above and beyond the necessary work for any one member in SDP, spending all night until 6AM before the friendly building a new robot. James was unexpectedly busy with other courseworks and without Lubo's last-minute contributions it would have been impossible to conduct a match with a missing robot.
\\

I would award an 8/10 to Iain Brown for putting a huge amount of time into SDP, doing his best working on the ball prediction code and keeping in close contact with myself nearly every day. He has been one of highest contributing members of our team in the last couple weeks.\\
\\

I would also award an 8/10 to Borislov Ikonomov for spending all possible time (when our robots were available) testing and making sure we were ready for the matches. No amount of code production from myself can account for the practical calibration and testing done by him in the time approaching deadlines.
